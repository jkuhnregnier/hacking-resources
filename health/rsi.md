# Repetitive Strain Injury

I have been struggling with RSI for some time as I sit a lot in front of the computer. However, starting in 2017 I have been completely able to limit it and almost get rid of it. 

## Wisdom
Chronic diseases are chronic because they are the result of our daily behavior. If you can change the underlying behavior, you can get overcome it. 

## How I overcame it
- Stuck to the pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of intense work, followed by 5 minutes of pause.
- Exercised more often - for me swimming worked as a miracle
- Some stretching and short exercises during the breaks
