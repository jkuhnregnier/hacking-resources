## How to Buy a Laptop

Here I list the sites I go to to find a laptop and to decide what to buy. 

### Criteria

* Can it be easily and cheaply repaired? 
* Can I easily get replacement parts?
* What do other people in my situation recommend?

### Resources

For the moment, I have two resources I can recommend to anyone (more will be added later):

* https://www.slant.co, here for example with a discussion on the [best laptop for programming](https://www.slant.co/topics/103/~best-laptop-for-programming)
* https://ifixit.org/, here for example with a discussion [on the MacBook Pro](https://ifixit.org/blog/10305/macbook-pro-2018-teardown/)
* https://www.reddit.com/, here for example with a discussion [on the best laptops for programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5tm0lr/good_programming_laptop/)

*Tip:* If you can't find what you are looking for directly on the site itself, simply head to [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com/) and enter `site:ifixit.org macbook pro`. This will help you quickly find the pages you need to, specifically if the site architecture is too broad or too hindering in identifying the right content. For reddit, this is a must.
