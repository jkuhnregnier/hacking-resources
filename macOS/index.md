## How to find the password of a wifi you are connected to?

Let's say the wifi we are seeking to find the password for is called 'home'. Do the following:

1. Search for 'Keychain Access' and open it. 
2. In the searchbar, search for the name/SSID of the wifi you are seeking to find the password for - in our case 'home'
3. Doubleclick on one of the entries - make sure it says 'Airport network password' under 'Kind'
4. Click on 'Show Password' and enter your user password for verification.

You'll now see the password and can do whatever you want with it.
